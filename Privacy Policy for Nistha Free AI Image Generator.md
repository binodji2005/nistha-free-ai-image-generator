# Privacy Policy for Nistha Free AI Image Generator

**Last Updated: August 2, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Nistha Free AI Image Generator ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our website and services (the "Service").

## 1\. Information We Do Not Collect

We are committed to your privacy. The Nistha Free AI Image Generator is designed to be a privacy-first service. We do not collect, store, or process any personal identifiable information (PII) from our users. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Your name
* Your email address
* Your IP address
* Any unique identifiers tied to your device or browser
* Any information about your location

## 2\. Information We Process (Non-Personal)

When you use our Service to generate images, the text prompts you enter are sent to the Pollinations.AI API for processing. We do not store these prompts on our servers. The image generated by the Pollinations.AI API is directly delivered to your browser and is not stored by us.

We may collect aggregated, non-personal analytical data about the usage of our Service, such as:

* The number of images generated.
* The types of styles or aspect ratios selected (without linking them to individual users).
* General, anonymized traffic data (e.g., page views).

This data is used solely to understand overall Service usage patterns and to improve the Service, and it cannot be used to identify any individual user.

## 3\. Third-Party Services

Our Service relies on third-party APIs for its core functionality:

* **Pollinations.AI:** Your text prompts are sent to Pollinations.AI for image generation. Please refer to Pollinations.AI's own privacy policy for information on how they handle data.
* **Google AdSense (if applicable):** If Google AdSense is integrated into this website, Google may collect and use data for advertising purposes. Please refer to Google's privacy policy for more information on their data practices.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services.

## 4\. Cookies

We do not use cookies to track personal information. However, third-party services integrated into our website (e.g., Google AdSense) may use cookies. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.

## 5\. Data Security

Given that we do not collect or store personal data, the risk of your personal information being compromised through our Service is minimal. We implement reasonable measures to protect the non-personal data we process from unauthorized access or disclosure.

## 6\. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
