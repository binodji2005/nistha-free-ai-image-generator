<h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>We are committed to your privacy. The Nistha Free AI Image Generator is designed to be a privacy-first service. We do not collect, store, or process any personal identifiable information (PII) from our users. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<h2>2. Information We Process (Non-Personal)</h2>
<p>When you use our Service to generate images, the text prompts you enter are sent to the Pollinations.AI API for processing. We do not store these prompts on our servers. The image generated by the Pollinations.AI API is directly delivered to your browser and is not stored by us.</p>
<p>We may collect aggregated, non-personal analytical data about the usage of our Service, such as:</p>
<ul>

<li>The types of styles or aspect ratios selected (without linking them to individual users).</li>
<li>General, anonymized traffic data (e.g., page views).</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is used solely to understand overall Service usage patterns and to improve the Service, and it cannot be used to identify any individual user.</p>
<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>Our Service relies on third-party APIs for its core functionality:</p>

<h2>4. Cookies</h2>
<p>We do not use cookies to track personal information. However, third-party services integrated into our website (e.g., Google AdSense) may use cookies. You can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings.</p>
<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>Given that we do not collect or store personal data, the risk of your personal information being compromised through our Service is minimal. We implement reasonable measures to protect the non-personal data we process from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>
